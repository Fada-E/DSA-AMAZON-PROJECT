# DSA-AMAZON-PROJECT
An exploratory data analysis on Amazon product reviews, discounts, and pricing. I designed it as a data analysis trainee at DSA Incubator. This excel-based project uses pivot tables, calculated fields, and interactive dashboards to extract actionable insights on product performance, category trends, customer engagement, and revenue opportunities.
